## Fashion Recommender
The proliferation of online shopping platforms has made it easier for consumers to shop from the comfort of their homes or on the go, and swiftly too! But the sheer volume of products available can be overwhelming. Traditional keyword-based text searches can often return irrelevant or inaccurate results, making it difficult for users to find clothing items that match their preferences. This proposal presents a novel approach that uses image recognition and pattern matching to revolutionize the online shopping experience, providing users with a more convenient and efficient way to find clothing items they like.
